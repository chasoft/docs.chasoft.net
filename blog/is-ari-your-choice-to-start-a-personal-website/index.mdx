Ari is special, and it is really not fit for everyone. Ari is not a WYSIWYG and you must work with a bit of coding and learning something new as reading some basic TypeScript code and following some instructions. In my previous blog post [Why you should have a personal website?](./why-you-should-have-a-personal-website), [the reason #2](./why-you-should-have-a-personal-website#2-acquire-new-skills), you must be the type of people who love to learn and experiment new things.
