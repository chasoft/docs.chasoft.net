8. Finally, you [deploy your website to Cloudflare](../guides/deployment.md) ✈🎉.

I know that you would need many efforts. That's why we say *"**build** your website"*. When everything is well done. You need to update your website regularly and build your great online presence to support your business 💯 or personal interests 💯.

Updating Aris is much more simple.

1. Open Visual Studio Code

3. Run `npm run dev` to preview your changes locally.
4. Go to `Source Control` panel *(Ctrl+Shift+G)* > for changes files, select all and choose `Stage changes` from popup menu > write some notes > Click `Commit` button to commit changes to local repository> Click `Sync Changes` button to upload changes to GitHub.

That's all. When you **sync changes** to GitHub, Cloudflare Pages will automatically deploy your changes. Basically, you will need to deal with updating Aris and commit to GitHub. The deployment is automatic 😎⚡.

<summary>Why must I use a `private GitHub` repository for Aris?</summary>

**Aris is not an open-source software**. So, please kindly keep your GitHub repository be `private`, or your repository would be taken down by the [DCMA policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Contract_Management_Agency) and your license would be rejected.

<summary>Where can I deploy my Aris?</summary>

**Aris** could be ported to run on any serverless platform _(thanks to [Remix Web Framework](https://remix.run/))_ such as:

* AWS
* Cloudflare worker
* FlyIo
* Netlify
* Vercel
* Any Express server

but for the very first version of **Aris** _(1.x)_, we only support to deploy to **`Cloudflare Pages`**. The reason is that **Aris** (1.x) focus on `standalone spirit` and `affordable spirit`. You would have a powerful Serverless Personal Website for `FREE` when deploy to `Cloudflare Pages`

In my experience, Cloudflare Pages is the best provider for such application as Aris.

<summary>What do you mean when saying "Aris has a `centralized information`"?</summary>

Aris has following dataType: `blog posts`, `portfolio`, `announcements`, `notes`, and `updates` which help you express almost everything you want as a personal website. And all data are all **connected** by 2 great features of Aris. They are: **`What's news?`** *(aka `latest updates`)* and **`Searching feature`** *(which can search for any data)*.

`What's news?` is sometime called `centralized information`.

<summary>How to get the `latitude` and `longitude` of a location?</summary>

To mark the location on [the map](../guides/content-blocks.mdx#map), you must provide a `latitude` and `longitude` numbers.

You can use Google Map and, select a location on the map and you will have the anchor

<BrowserWindow
  url={
    <span>
      .../Clarke+Quay/@
      <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold", color: "red" }}>1.29105,103.8439817</span>
      ,
      <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold", color: "blue" }}>17</span>
      z/data=!3m1!5s0x31...
    </span>
  }
>

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<summary>How to control `banner image` of each page?</summary>

Let's take a look at a page, then you would know know to control `banner image`. Open `app\routes\__layout\contact.tsx`, go to `handle`.

```ts
...
export const handle = {
	bannerImage: bannerImages.contact
}
...
```

 You can see that the banner image of `https://your-domain.com/contact` is `bannerImages.contact`. Then, if you want to change its banner image, just go to `app\data\settings\bannerImages.tsx` and modify `bannerImages.contact`.

 The inteface of bannerImage:

 ```ts
 export type BannerImage = {
	/**
	 * In case you don't want headerImage,
	 * then, at that route, export handle with `disable = true`
	 */
	disable?: boolean
	src: ImgSrcSet
	/**
	 * This setting is very useful,
	 * feel free to ask me for any help
	 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position
	 */
	objectPosition?: string,
	backgroundColor?: string,
	opacity?: string
	height?: string
	/**
	 * if we want a title and a subTitle displayed above the image
	 */
	title?: {
		text: string,
		subText?: string,
		color?: string
		textCenter?: boolean
	}
}
 ```
