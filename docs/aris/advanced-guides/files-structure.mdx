# Files structure

## Root folder

:::info

- **System Pages <span style={{ color: "red"}}>(in red)</span>**: do not touch these files and folders unless you know what you are doing
- **User Pages <span style={{ color: "green"}}>(in green)</span>**: where you do the modification. You often need to read [content blocks](../guides/content-blocks.mdx) to know the structure of content blocks. To use them correctly.
- All `.mdx` files are where you write your blog posts/ articles, and they have the most simple syntax. Just take a look, and you will know how simple it is.
