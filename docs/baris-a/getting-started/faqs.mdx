<summary>Why must I use a `private GitHub` repository for Baris-A?</summary>

**Baris-A is not an open-source software**. So, please kindly keep your GitHub repository be `private`, or your repository would be taken down by the [DCMA policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Contract_Management_Agency) and your license would be rejected.

<summary>Why the name of you product is `Baris-A`, not `Baris`?</summary>

Baris is a series of serverless template. The very first item is `Baris-A` for Personal Website! I will publish a lot of template for all your needs soon.

They would be: `Baris-B`, `Baris-C`, `Baris-D`, `Baris-H`,...

<summary>Where can I deploy my Baris-A?</summary>

**Baris-A** could be ported to run on any serverless platform _(thanks to [Remix Web Framework](https://remix.run/))_ such as:

* AWS
* Cloudflare worker
* FlyIo
* Netlify
* Vercel
* Any Express server

but for the very first version of **Baris-A** _(1.x)_, we only support to deploy to **`Cloudflare Pages`**. The reason is that **Baris-A** (1.x) focus on `standalone spirit` and `affordable spirit`. You would have a beautifyl Serverless Personal Website for `FREE` when deploy to `Cloudflare Pages`

In my experience, Cloudflare Pages is the best provider for such application as Baris-A.

<summary>How to get the `latitude` and `longitude` of a location?</summary>

To mark the location on [the map](../guides/content-blocks.mdx#map), you must provide a `latitude` and `longitude` numbers.

You can use Google Map and, select a location on the map and you will have the anchor

<BrowserWindow
  url={
    <span>
      .../Clarke+Quay/@
      <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold", color: "red" }}>1.29105,103.8439817</span>
      ,
      <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold", color: "blue" }}>17</span>
      z/data=!3m1!5s0x31...
    </span>
  }
>

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
