Deploy a serverless to Cloudflare Pages can not be easier. First you need to create a [private](../getting-started/faqs.mdx) GitHub repository and publish your Baris-A there. The next step is to go to Cloudflare Pages and publish your website with just a few clicks.

:::info
To check whether you declare email *(which is used to register GitHub)* with Git or not, try following command:
```
git config --global user.email
```
If it returns your email address, then everything should be fine to continue.

Assumes that you have had your local development environment already. Follows the instructions below to get started:
