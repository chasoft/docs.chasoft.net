# Blog & Portfolio

There is no `blog` and `Portfolio` in Baris-A. All you have are `pages` and `pages`. But you still create your own simple **blog** or **portfolio** with pages. The idea is as following:

- **Your blog page**: create a page with `slug = "/blog"`
- **Your blog post page**: create a page with `slug = "/blog/blog-post-name"` and at the head of each child page, let you place a `breadcrumbs`. The same code as below:

```ts
const article1: Page = {
	settings: {
		title: "My blog post title",
		subTitle: "The blog post's category Name",
		description: "A short description of the blog post",
    //highlight-next-line
		slug: "/blog/an-article",
		hideSidebarInSmallScreen: true,
    ...
	},
	content: [
		{
			type: "breadcrumbs",
			data: [
				{ title: "Blog", slug: "/blog" },
				{ title: "Category name", slug: "/category-name" },
				{ title: "My blog post title" },
			]
		},
		{
			...
		},
    ...
    {
			...
		},
	]
}

export default article1
```

After all you would have a structure like this:

- https : //your-domain.com/blog
- https : //your-domain.com/blog/article-1
- https : //your-domain.com/blog/article-2
- https : //your-domain.com/blog/article-3

Do not forget to declare all your pages in `app\data\pages\index.ts`
