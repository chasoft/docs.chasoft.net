# Installation

To use Ari, you must have a local development environment: `local` or `cloud`. Currently, I have both. `1` local for daily activities *(in my desktop computer)* and `1` in the cloud for ad-hoc updates or when I'm away from my computer *(borrow any computer, access a website, login and there you go... no setup)*.

Anyway, at the very first time, let you just focus on the local environment with Visual Studio Code only. When you get used to Ari and Ari becomes your online platform, then setting up Cloud environment just takes 5-10 minutes.

## Preparations

1. **Create all essential accounts**

    - [GitHub](https://github.com/signup): to store your data
    - [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up): to host your website for free
    - [Mailjet](https://app.mailjet.com/signup?lang=en_US): to let your contact page working

2. **Set up your local development environment with Visual Studio Code**

    - Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

:::note  
Restart your computer for NodeJS CLI takes effect!
:::

3. **Get default Ari up and running locally**

  To ensure that your local development environment is correctly configured.

    + Extract your Ari *(the Zip file which you downloaded after purchased)* to desired folder.
    + Use Visual Studio Code to open this folder *(File -> Open folder...)*
    + Open the terminal *(Ctrl + `)* and run following command exact order:
      * `npm install` - this would take you 5-10 minutes to finish the installation
      * `npm run build` - less than 30 seconds
      * `npm run start` - a couple of seconds to start the local server

    Ari should be up and running for now ðŸŽ‰.

:::note  
To stop the local server, (make sure the terminal is active) press `Ctrl + C`

4. **Update Ari's configuration**

  Open and update all available information which you have at **`app\data\settings\config.tsx`**.

5. **Design and Prepare data for your personal website**

  You need to prepare something:
    - A logo of yours *(it should be your avatar, for this is your personal website)*
    - Your personal information
    - Icons (https://icons8.com/icons, https://www.flaticon.com,...)
    - Pictures for your website (https://unsplash.com)

6. **Testing the Ari locally**

  Let you run `npm run dev` to start the local server to preview your website. When you save any changes, local server will automatically be updated accordingly.

  :::info
  Don't forget to read [files structure](../advanced-guides/files-structure.mdx) to build your awareness about the structure of Ari.

7. **Deploy your website to Cloudflare Pages**

  **Git setup**

  - Open Visual Studio Code
  - Open Ari folder (File -> Open Folder...)
  - Go to Source Control page (Ctrl+Shift+X)
  - Click Install Git button

  **Declare GitHub account**

  - Open goto Terminal window of Visual Studio Code, run following command

    ```
    git config --global user.email "demo1@chasoft.net"
    git config --global user.name "Brian"
    ```

    `user.email` is email which you registered GitHub account
    `user.name` is your name or whatever name you want.

    **Deploy to GitHub repository**

    After installing **git**, let you restart your Visual Studio Code.

    - Go to Source Control Page (Ctrl+Shift+X)
    - Click a new button called "Publish to GitHub repository"
    - A dropdown menu will be showed, and let you enter your repository name and remember to choose **private repository** *(do not choose **public repository**)*

    If any dialog showe to ask you to login to GitHub, just do it. Let you choose `Browser` open.

:::warning
Publish `ari` to **private** repository, not public repository. For ari is not open-source application.
:::

  **Deploy to Cloudflare pages**

  - Sign in to Cloudflare
  - Go to Pages, connect to git => github
  - Create a project => choose your repository
  - Choose **Remix** as your framework
  
  That's it. Enjoy your website! Promote our website through any channels you have available!
