# Installation

To use Ari, you must have a local development environment: `local` or `cloud`. Currently, I have both. `1` local for daily activities *(in my desktop computer)* and `1` in the cloud for ad-hoc updates or when I'm away from my computer *(borrow any computer, access a website, login and there you go... no setup)*.

Anyway, at the very first time, let you just focus on the local environment with Visual Studio Code only. When you get used to Ari and Ari becomes your online platform, then setting up Cloud environment just takes 5-10 minutes.

## Preparations

1. **Create all essential accounts**

    - [GitHub](https://github.com/signup): to store your data
    - [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up): to host your website for free
    - [Mailjet](https://app.mailjet.com/signup?lang=en_US): to let your contact page working

2. **Set up your local development environment with Visual Studio Code**

    - Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - Install Node.js 
    - Install NPM
	- Install ...

3. **Get default Ari up and running locally**

  To ensure that your local development environment is correctly configured.

4. **Update Ari's configuration**

5. **Design and Prepare data for your personal website**

    You need to prepare something:
    - A logo of yours *(it should be your avatar, for this is your personal website)*
	- Your personal information
	- Icons (https://icons8.com/icons, https://www.flaticon.com,...)
	- Pictures for your website (https://unsplash.com)

6. **Testing the Ari locally**

7. **Deploy your website to Cloudflare Pages**

That's it. Enjoy your website! Promote our website through any channels you have available!
