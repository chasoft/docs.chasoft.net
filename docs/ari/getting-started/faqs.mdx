7. When you have any questions, try to find in our [documentation](https://docs.chasoft.net/docs/ari/intro), or ask me via [email](mailto:support@chasoft.net).

8. Finally, you [deploy your website to Cloudflare](../guides/deployment.md) ✈🎉.

I know that you would need many efforts. That's why we say *"**build** your website"*. When everything is well done. You need to update your website regularly and build your great online presence to support your business 💯 or personal interests 💯.

Updating Ari is much more simple.

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Do the update: add new blog post, or new portfolio article, or new announcements, or new notes, or new updates.
3. Run `npm run dev` to preview your changes locally.
4. Go to `Source Control` panel *(Ctrl+Shift+G)* > for changes files, select all and choose `Stage changes` from popup menu > write some notes > Click `Commit` button to commit changes to local repository> Click `Sync Changes` button to upload changes to GitHub.

That's all. When you **sync changes** to GitHub, Cloudflare Pages will automatically deploy your changes. Basically, you will need to deal with updating Ari and commit to GitHub. The deployment is automatic 😎⚡.

<summary>Why must I use a `private GitHub` repository for Ari?</summary>

**Ari is not an open-source software**. So, please kindly keep your GitHub repository be `private`, or your repository would be taken down by the [DCMA policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Contract_Management_Agency) and your license would be rejected.

<summary>Where can I deploy my Ari?</summary>

**Ari** could be ported to run on any serverless platform _(thanks to [Remix Web Framework](https://remix.run/))_ such as:

* AWS
* Cloudflare worker
* FlyIo
* Netlify
* Vercel
* Any Express server

but for the very first version of **Ari** _(1.x)_, we only support to deploy to **`Cloudflare Pages`**. The reason is that **Ari** (1.x) focus on `standalone spirit` and `affordable spirit`. You would have a powerful Serverless Personal Website for `FREE` when deploy to `Cloudflare Pages`

In my experience, Cloudflare Pages is the best provider for such application as Ari.

<summary>What do you mean when saying "Ari has a `centralized information`"?</summary>

Ari has following dataType: `blog posts`, `portfolio`, `announcements`, `notes`, and `updates` which help you express almost everything you want as a personal website. And all data are all **connected** by 2 great features of Ari. They are: **`What's news?`** *(aka `latest updates`)* and **`Searching feature`** *(which can search for any data)*.

`What's news?` is sometime called `centralized information`.

To mark the location on [the map](../guides/content-blocks.mdx#map), you must provide a `latitude` and `longitude` numbers.

You can use Google Map and, select a location on the map and you will have the anchor

      <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold", color: "blue" }}>17</span>
      z/data=!3m1!5s0x31...
    </span>
  }
