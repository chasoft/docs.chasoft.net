# Configuration

All configurations are located at **`app\data\settings\config.tsx`**. Just open the file and read from top to bottom. Each configuration has been commented. Don't be panic and just go ahead and update your information.

Next is to read **[files structure](../advanced-guides/files-structure.mdx)** to build your awareness about the structure of Ari. Or if you get lost, take a look at **[FAQs page](./faqs.mdx)** and read the answer of *"I get lost, I don't know what to do"*.
