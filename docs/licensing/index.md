# Licensing

If your end product including the item is going to be free to the end user then a Regular License is what you need. An Extended License is required if the end user must pay to use the end product.

| | Regular | Extended |
|--|:--:|:--:|
| **Number of end products** | 1 | unlimited |
| **Use in a single end product** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Use in an end product that's sold** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **On-demand products/services**<br />_(e.g. "made to order" or "create your own" apps and sites)_ | ❌ | ✅ |

## Note to freelancers and creative agencies

You may charge your client for your services to create an end product, even under the Regular License. But you can't use one of our Regular License on multiple clients or jobs.
